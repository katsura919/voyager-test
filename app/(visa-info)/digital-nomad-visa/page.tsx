// ─── FAQ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Can I apply from the Philippines?",
    a: "Yes. Philippine passport holders apply at the Spanish Consulate General in Manila (or Cebu for Visayas/Mindanao applicants). You do not need to be in Spain to apply. We guide you through the entire process remotely.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the minimum income requirement?",
    a: "€2,894/month gross ~ roughly PHP 196,000/month at current rates. This is 200% of Spain's minimum wage (SMI). You need to show consistent income for at least 3 months, ideally 6. Freelancers can combine multiple client incomes to meet this threshold.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm a virtual assistant / freelancer. Do I qualify?",
    a: "Yes, if your clients are based outside Spain and you earn consistently above the income threshold. You'll need freelance contracts (even informal ones converted to proper agreements), bank statements showing regular transfers, and possibly a DTI or business registration. We'll assess your specific setup on the strategy call.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Beckham Law tax benefit?",
    a: "The Beckham Law (Ley Beckham) allows employed DNV holders ~ those working for a foreign company as an employee ~ to pay a flat 24% tax rate on Spanish-sourced income for the first 6 years, instead of the progressive scale (up to 47%). Autónomos (self-employed/freelancers) do not qualify for this regime. However, if your clients are all outside Spain, your foreign-sourced income is generally not subject to Spanish income tax. Tax rules are complex ~ we always recommend consulting a Spanish tax advisor (gestor) for your specific setup.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the visa take to process?",
    a: "The Spanish Consulate in Manila typically takes 30–90 days to process from the date of your appointment. We recommend starting 4–6 months before your target move date to account for document gathering, apostille queues, and appointment availability.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my family come with me?",
    a: "Yes ~ family reunification is possible. Your spouse and dependent children can apply as family members of the main visa holder. They'll need their own supporting documents (proof of relationship, passports, health insurance). We can guide family applications as an add-on.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I don't meet the income requirement yet?",
    a: "Honesty first: if you don't currently meet the income threshold, applying isn't the right move. We'll tell you that upfront on the strategy call and suggest what to work toward before reapplying. Some clients use the 6–12 months to build their income and then apply. We'd rather give you a realistic timeline than take your money on a weak application.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this the same as the non-lucrative visa or student visa?",
    a: "No. The Digital Nomad Visa (Startup Act / Ley de Startups) is specifically for people who work remotely for foreign companies or clients. It's different from the Non-Lucrative Visa (which requires passive income, no work allowed) and the Student Visa. The DNV is the right path if you earn money through remote work.",
