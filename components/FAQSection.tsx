    question: "What is the Spain Digital Nomad Visa?",
    answer:
      "The Spain Digital Nomad Visa (officially called the Visa para teletrabajo de carácter internacional) is a residence visa that allows remote workers and freelancers to live and work legally in Spain. It's designed for people who work remotely for companies or clients outside of Spain. The visa is initially granted for up to 3 years and can be renewed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the whole process take?",
    answer:
      "The online application through the UGE portal typically takes 20–45 business days for a decision. Factor in time for gathering documents, apostilles, and translations, that can add 2–4 weeks. Start to approval: expect 2–3 months total.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the income requirements?",
    answer:
      "You need to prove a minimum monthly income of approximately €2,849 (200% of Spain's minimum wage). This can come from employment, freelance work, or business ownership. The key requirement is that your income must come from clients or employers outside of Spain.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a lawyer to apply?",
    answer:
      "No, that's exactly why this playbook exists. The process is straightforward with the right guidance. I applied without a lawyer and saved €2,000+. The playbook gives you everything you need. If you want hands-on support, the Strategy Call or full package is there for that.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I bring my family?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Spain allows you to include family members in your application or they can apply for family reunification after you receive your visa. This includes your spouse/partner and dependent children. Each family member needs their own documents, and income requirements increase slightly per person.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to speak Spanish?",
    answer:
      "No Spanish language requirement for the visa. That said, basic Spanish helps a lot with daily life and bureaucratic steps. The UGE portal is in Spanish, but the documents just need certified translations, no language test required.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about taxes? Do I pay in Spain?",
    answer:
      "Yes, once you're a tax resident you'll be subject to Spanish taxes. The Beckham Law (Régimen Especial para Trabajadores Desplazados) offers a flat 24% tax rate for 6 years ~ but this applies to employed workers only, not autónomos (self-employed). If you're freelancing for foreign clients, your income is generally not considered Spanish-sourced and may be exempt. Tax rules vary by situation ~ always consult a Spanish gestor or tax advisor.",
